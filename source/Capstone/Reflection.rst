Final Report - Reflective Summary
=================================

What new technical skills did you learn during this semester?
----------------------------------------------------------------
This semester, I chose to work on the project instead of research because I
thought I already knew everything I was going to do and how to get the site
working the way I wanted.  Almost as soon as I started, I realized I completely
forgot how to connect a database to a website.   I had taken classes in database
and SQL, but used Microsoft SQL Management Studios instead of actually tying it
to a website.  As a result, I had to relearn how to tie a database to a website
so I can add, modify, and remove records automatically instead of manually in the
database itself.

As time progressed and I got everything setup the way I wanted and got the
database connected to the site and all of the SQL working correctly, along with
adding SQL validations, I was informed my method was very "old school" or
outdated.  With help, I learned how to use JSON to perform the javascript and
SQL functions I needed.  Before this class, I was very uncomfortable using JSON
for anything, let alone for functional database updates.  I'm still not 100%
comfortable with it, but that is just because it's new and is a very powerful
tool that will just take time and lots of practice to full understand all of it's
uses and be able to create a JSON script from memory instead of having to look
it up.

How might you continue to learn skills after college, so that you keep up-to-date?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Even after I graduated DMACC with an AAS in Web Development, I continued building
websites, either for myself, or for paying clients.  Doing that helped me stay
fairly current with the new methods of web development; so, I will continue to
do that.

Additionally, on my portfolio site, I have a LOT of work I did from several
years ago that I need to go through and update the code on, so when I get time,
I will go back through each of the projects I worked on and bring them up-to-date.

Another way I try to stay current, is I will go to different job applications and
read the required skills.  If there's something I don't know or am not familiar
with, I will research it, and build a website using the new skills.

What skills did you learn about using written communication to communicate technical subjects?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have learned a lot about it, like how it's easier to do in PyCharm, how to
break down your headings and pages, and how to add images, code blocks, and
links.  I had never heard of Technical Writing until this class and didn't ever
see the purpose of it when it was introduced.

I'm assuming the purpose is provide documentation to the client as to what you
did, why you did it, and how it adds value to the site.  It's also a way to keep
track of records and time so you can bill the client appropriately with a broken
down list of what was done on the site.

If that's really the case, honestly, I think it would be a lot easier to just
write everything down on a Word doc and send that to the client, and it would
be just as effective.  If that's not the case, then I guess I don't really
understand the purpose of that exercise, or when/why it would be relevant in a
live working environment.

Explain how you see written communication factoring into your future career?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
As I mentioned above, I honestly don't see the benefit or when I'd ever use it
in a live work environment.  Maybe it's just because I didn't really catch the
concept when I was working with it for this class, but to me, it seems like there
are several different methods that are easier and less time consuming to
communicate to the employer or client about what work you performed and how much
time you spent on each item.

After college, how can you improve your written communication?
--------------------------------------------------------------
Also, as mentioned above, I have never heard of technical writing before this
class, and I graduated DMACC with an AAS in Web Development.  So, unless an
employer specifically asks for documentation using the technical writing skills,
I probably won't work on learning more about it after this class.  If an employer
does require it, I can honestly say I have a basic understanding of it and know
how to write it.
