Incorporating JSON
==================

One way to insert data into the databaes is use to JSON.  That allows you to use
JavaScript with SQL to insert or manipulate the data both on the client side, and
the server side.  JSON is used for collecting and sending data over a network
connection. It is mostly used to send data between a server and web
applications.

According to Paul Craven, JSON is the more modern way of inserting data into a
database.

I am current not entirely sure how to use JSON and how it works with databases,
so I will update this section when I learn more about it.
