Incorporating JSON
==================

According to Paul Craven, the more modern way to insert data into the databaes
is use to JSON.  That allows you to use JavaScript with SQL to insert or
manipulate the data both on the client side, and the server side.  JSON is used
for collecting and sending data over a network connection. It is mostly used to
send data between a server and a web page.

I am current not entirely sure how to use JSON and how it works with databases,
so I will update this section when I learn more about it.
