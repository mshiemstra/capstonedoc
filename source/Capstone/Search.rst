Creating Search Function
========================

In order for teachers to be able to sort through hundreds of different students
for the one they're needing to view, a search function is in order.  Up until
now, the entire site has been using JavaScript, which is a bit outdated in today's
technology world.  Before working with JSON, the old JavaScript code needs to be
updated to jQuery.  Not only is jQuery newer, but it greatly simplifies the functions.
In addition to simplified functions, it's a much more powerful tool, allowing you
more freedom to do exactly what you want.

After the JavaScript code was converted to jQuery, the next step was to learn JSON.
This, plus the use of AJAX, allow you to use JavaScript on the serverside. I'm still
not familiar or comfortable using JSON or AJAX, so the next chapter will include
the new skills of how to use them.
